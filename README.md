# Lucid Programming
Simple, fast and minimalist programming language for programming via SMS, MUD, IRC, etc.

Lucid Programming is the second programming language in the programming series, see
[civilized](https://github.com/fantasyui-com/civilized) for previous reference implementation and original POC.

## About

Lucid Programming aims to be a stateless, variable free, action execution language with
@mentions support. Designed for IRC with strong SMS support.

Lucid Programming hopes to support data pipes via Apple Automator like concept, where
one line may send data to the next. This may allow basic variable-like declarations.

Note that, any and all type of advanced programming will take the Marko approach.
